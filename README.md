## Some of my Toontown things I've made

### From fall 2016 to Late spring 2017, I was part of the Project Altis team.
### During the spring of 2018, I rejoined the Corporate Clash Team. 
While on Clash, I had started quite a few projects, and had planned more, that were never completed.

One of the biggest was Custom JSON based GUIs.

The plan for this was to allow users to customize their GUI how ever they'd like. Similarly to how Minecraft: Bedrock Edition allows. 

The .JSON file would allow users to tweak and remove already existing gui elements, and add more.

For instance, a user could  move the health meter to the top corner if they wanted to, or they could remove the Chat Log button if you never use it.

For more savvy users, they can add their own GUI elements. A user could for instance, add their Toon Tasks to the MAIN HUD

Here is a little concept drawing showing examples of what could be done
